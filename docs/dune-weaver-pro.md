Hi everyone, I'm so excited that you're setting out to build this project. I had a ton of fun building this from the ground up, and I hope you do too.

Please start by checking out the Bill of Materials (BOM) and order the relevant parts. Next up, please assemble the motors into the base, work on the Software and Firmware and make sure everything works before moving on to the Assembly Instructions. Last but not least, check out the WLED install guide.

If you have any questions or feedback, please use the #qna-dune-weaver-pro channel in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/RWJakERneH). Good luck and have fun!
