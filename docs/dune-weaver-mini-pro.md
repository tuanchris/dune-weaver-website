# Dune Weaver Mini Pro

Welcome! I'm thrilled that you decided to build the Dune Weaver Mini Pro (DWMP)! Building on the success of the Dune Weaver Pro, I set out to design the perfect holiday present that you can build!

Please start by checking out the Bill of Materials (BOM) and order the relevant parts. Next up, please assemble the motors into the base, work on the Software and Firmware and make sure everything works before moving on to the Assembly Instructions. Last but not least, check out the LED install guide.

If you have any questions or feedback, please use the #qna-dune-weaver-pro channel in our Discord. Good luck and have fun!
