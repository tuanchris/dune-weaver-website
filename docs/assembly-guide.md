# Assembly Guide

This guide covers the assembly process for DIY Dune Weaver kits.

## Tools Required

- Phillips screwdriver
- Allen key set (provided)
- Wire strippers (for custom wiring)
- Multimeter (recommended for electrical testing)

## Step 1: Frame Assembly

### Base Frame
1. Identify all frame components
2. Connect corner pieces using M3 screws
3. Ensure all joints are tight but not over-tightened
4. Verify the frame is square

### Motor Mount
1. Attach motor mount bracket to base
2. Secure with provided bolts
3. Check alignment with bearing guides

## Step 2: Electronics Installation

### Stepper Motors
1. Mount X-axis stepper motor
2. Mount Y-axis stepper motor
3. Connect motor cables to controller board
4. Route cables neatly to avoid interference

### Controller Board
1. Mount controller board in designated location
2. Connect power input terminals
3. Connect motor outputs
4. Attach endstop switches (if applicable)

## Step 3: Belt and Pulley System

### Installing Belts
1. Thread timing belt through pulleys
2. Adjust tension using tensioner screws
3. Ensure belts run smoothly without binding
4. Test movement by hand before powering on

### Magnet Carriage
1. Attach magnetic ball holder to carriage
2. Mount carriage on belt system
3. Verify smooth motion across full range

## Step 4: Wiring and Testing

### Electrical Connections
1. Double-check all connections match wiring diagram
2. Verify polarity of power connections
3. Ensure no loose wires or shorts

### Initial Testing
1. Power on with USB connection only
2. Test each axis individually
3. Perform homing sequence
4. Run test pattern

## Step 5: Final Assembly

### Table Top
1. Install glass or acrylic table top
2. Add sand containment edges
3. Clean all surfaces

### Calibration
1. Run calibration routine
2. Adjust belt tension if needed
3. Fine-tune speed and acceleration settings

## Safety Notes

- Always disconnect power before working on electronics
- Wear safety glasses when cutting or drilling
- Keep workspace clean and organized
- Test incrementally rather than all at once
