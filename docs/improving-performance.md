# Improving Pattern Performance and Reducing Noise

## Recommendations

Based on experimental observations:

### Material Choice
- **80–100 Mesh Sand**: "Use if you value a crisp, tactile line" but be prepared to manage wiggling through fine-tuning
- **Baking Soda**: Preferred if smoother performance matters more than tactile feedback

### Ball Choice
- **Magnetic Ball**: Highly recommended with thicker trays, though monitor wear over time
- **Faux Leather**: Apply to table surface to reduce ball wiggling
- **Optimization**: "It's a delicate balance—sometimes less sand or using a different ball can yield significant improvements"

## Baking Soda vs. 80–100 Mesh Sand

### Baking Soda
**Advantages:**
- Creates uniform, fine-grained surface reducing wiggling
- Consistent behavior across many builds

**Disadvantages:**
- Less defined texture or "crisp" line quality
- Limited customization options
- Absorbs moisture over time

### 80–100 Mesh Sand
**Advantages:**
- Provides defined visual and tactile feedback
- Customizable (can mix with additives like UV-reactive materials)
- Preferred by many builders

**Disadvantages:**
- Larger grains cause ball "tripping" or wiggling
- Thicker trays amplify bouncing issues
- Requires careful pairing with appropriate ball types

## Ball Selection and Modifications

### Understanding Ball Wiggling
The ball wiggles when "it hits a relatively large grain of sand or baking soda on a hard surface." This inconsistency can disconnect magnetic balls from the magnet, especially at outer edges where the radial arm bends.

### Magnetic Ball Options

**Advantages:**
- Enhanced stability, particularly with thicker trays
- Reduces wiggling by maintaining base contact
- Slight bottom wear creates ideal flat surfaces

**Disadvantages:**
- Gradual wear from sliding rather than rolling
- Worn ball bottoms may widen, creating thicker lines
- Initially increases noise by 10-20% (diminishes as wear flattens the bottom)

### Ball Size Recommendations

- **5mm**: Too small and light; may cause wiggling
- **10mm**: "Works best for me, especially with a little wear in the bottom"
- **15mm**: Functions well without resolution loss; produces larger lines

**Maintenance Note**: Bottom wear gradually expands over time. Some builders experiment with foam padding to prevent excessive degradation.

## Faux Leather Enhancements

**Advantages:**
- Causes sand to sink slightly when the ball passes, smoothing its path
- Eliminates roughly 90% of wiggling
- Significantly reduces table noise

**Disadvantages:**
- Increases overall thickness
- May require eventual replacement with extended use

## Tray/Base Considerations

Thick OMBONAD trays can cause performance issues including ball disconnection from magnetic force, particularly at the perimeter where "the radial arm bends downward due to gravity."

**Solutions:**
- Use thinner trays to maintain magnetic contact
- Pair thick trays with magnetic balls
- Adjust ball type to overcome magnetic force challenges
