# Building Your First Sand Table

Ready to build your own kinetic sand table? This guide will walk you through the essential steps and considerations for your first build.

## What You'll Need

### Hardware
- Stepper motors (NEMA 17 recommended)
- Motor controller board
- Magnet for ball bearing manipulation
- Ball bearing (typically 1/2" to 1" diameter)
- Frame material (wood, acrylic, or 3D printed)
- Sand (fine grain works best)

### Software
- Arduino or Raspberry Pi
- Motor control firmware
- Pattern generation software

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Choose Your Design

We offer several designs to match different skill levels:
- **DW Mini** - Perfect for beginners, compact size
- **OG DW** - Original design with proven reliability
- **DWP (Dune Weaver Pro)** - Advanced features for experienced builders
- **DWMP (Mini Pro)** - Professional features in a compact form

### 2. Gather Materials

Download the bill of materials (BOM) from our [MakerWorld page](https://makerworld.com). Most components can be sourced from common electronics suppliers.

### 3. Assembly

Follow the assembly instructions carefully. Take your time with:
- Motor alignment
- Magnet positioning
- Frame stability
- Wiring connections

### 4. Calibration

Proper calibration is crucial for smooth operation:
1. Set motor steps per revolution
2. Calibrate center position
3. Test pattern execution
4. Adjust speed and acceleration

## Tips for Success

- **Start small** - Begin with the Mini version if you're new to building
- **Join the community** - Our Discord is full of helpful builders
- **Document your build** - Share your progress and learn from others
- **Experiment** - Try different sands, patterns, and customizations

## Common Issues

### Patterns Look Distorted
- Check motor calibration
- Verify magnet strength and position
- Ensure ball bearing is the correct size

### Motors Skipping Steps
- Reduce acceleration settings
- Check power supply capacity
- Verify motor driver current settings

## Next Steps

Once you've completed your build:
1. Share photos in our Discord community
2. Try creating custom patterns
3. Contribute improvements to the open-source designs
4. Help other builders on their journey

Happy building!
