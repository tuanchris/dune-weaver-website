# Welcome to Dune Weaver

We're excited to share our journey in creating beautiful kinetic sand tables that bring mesmerizing patterns to life. Dune Weaver is more than just a product—it's a community of makers, artists, and enthusiasts who appreciate the intersection of art and technology.

## What is a Kinetic Sand Table?

A kinetic sand table is a captivating device that uses a magnet-driven ball bearing to create intricate patterns in sand. Controlled by precision motors and creative software, these tables produce ever-changing geometric designs that are both relaxing and inspiring to watch.
